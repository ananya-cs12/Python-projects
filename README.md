# Python Projects
Welcome to my collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Python projects â€” each crafted to build logic, strengthen skills, and solve real-world problems.

## About 
This repo contains 10 unique projects built using only core Python (no external frameworks, except `random`, `time`, or simple file handling). Each project is self-contained, console-based, and beginner-friendly.
